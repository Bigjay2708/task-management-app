To fix the styling issues, I recommend downgrading Tailwind CSS from version 4 to a more stable version. Run these commands in your terminal:

npm uninstall tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss
npm install tailwindcss@3.3.0 postcss@8.4.31 autoprefixer@10.4.15 --save-dev

This will install more stable versions that work well with Next.js.
